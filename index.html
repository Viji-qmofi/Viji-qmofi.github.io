            My curiosity about technology began the first time I touched a computer,
            and it has continued to shape my learning and career choices ever since.
            Today, I’m intentionally building the skills needed to grow as a
            software developer.
        </p>

             
         <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Viji</strong><br>   
            I am an aspiring software developer with 7+ years of IT support experience,
            known for strong problem-solving skills, reliability, and taking full
            ownership of responsibilities. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer
            Science and an MBA in Resource Management, which provide both technical
            depth and a strong understanding of business processes.
        </p>

         <p>
            While working in IT support, I realized my long-term passion lies in
            software development. During a career break, I continued learning
            independently and supported a startup with manual testing and basic
            automation, staying closely connected to product quality and development
            workflows.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m gaining hands-on experience with Java, Spring Boot, React, REST APIs, SQL, 
            and Git through project-based learning at LaunchCode. I’m looking for a junior 
            software developer role where I can contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate 
            with experienced teammates, and continue growing my skills.
        </p>
